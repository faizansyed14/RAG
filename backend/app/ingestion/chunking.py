"""Shared large-file chunking for ingestion modules that would otherwise render a
whole file as one preformatted "code" block (JSON, Python, and markdown files with
no real headings of their own). A big blob under a single heading gives PageIndex
nothing to detect a structure from -- confirmed live: a 107KB/3559-line JSON export
rendered to 52 pages with one heading for the whole document, so flash mode fell
back to "one node per page" and was rejected outright (FLAT_TREE_MAX_NODES=10 in
rag_core/flash/api.py). Splitting into fixed-size line chunks, each under its own
heading, gives real section breaks to detect instead.
