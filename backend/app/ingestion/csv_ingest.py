"""
CSV ingestion. The tree engine's local mode only accepts PDF input (see
app/rag_service.py's module docstring), so this reads the sheet into grid
table block(s) and renders them through the shared block pipeline
(blocks_ingest.py), same as a DOCX table.

A large CSV rendered as one giant table under a single heading gives
PageIndex nothing to detect a structure from -- confirmed live: a 144-row
register rendered to 12 pages with only one heading for the whole document,
so flash mode fell back to "one node per page" and was rejected outright
(FLAT_TREE_MAX_NODES=10 in rag_core/flash/api.py). Splitting the data rows
into fixed-size chunks, each under its own heading, is necessary but not
sufficient -- also confirmed live: even with a heading per chunk, a
ReportLab Table flowable's grid/cell layout still defeated PageIndex's
heading detector every time (toc_source stayed "pages", still rejected,
regardless of chunk size). Flattening each chunk's rows to labeled text
lines instead of a real table fixed it (toc_source: "detected"). The agent
reads extracted text, not visual layout, so this costs nothing in practice
-- it only changes what the rendered PDF preview looks like for a large CSV.
